# Rusty-Playground

My personal Rust playground where I experiment with and learn the Rust programming language through small, focused projects. Each directory contains a standalone application showcasing different Rust concepts and patterns. Perfect for beginners looking for practical examples or anyone interested in seeing Rust applied to real-world problems.

## Projects

- **Hello-Rust**: A simple "Hello World" application to get started with Rust.
- **Temperature-Converter**: A utility to convert between different temperature units.
- **Simple-Calculator**: A basic calculator implementation demonstrating Rust's input handling and arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

Each project is a standalone Rust application. To run any project:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Use `cargo run` to build and execute the project

```bash
cd Hello-Rust/hello_rust
cargo run
```

## Learning Goals

This repository documents my journey learning Rust, focusing on:

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrency without data races
- Abstraction without overhead
- Practical application development
