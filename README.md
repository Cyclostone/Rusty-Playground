# Rusty-Playground

A step-by-step adventure through Rust programming with practical mini-projects. Follow along as I build small applications from simple calculators to more complex systems, documenting my learning process and code improvements. Perfect for beginners looking to see real Rust code in action or for anyone interested in practical Rust application development.

## Projects

- **Hello-Rust**: A simple "Hello World" application to get started with Rust.
- **Temperature-Converter**: A utility to convert between different temperature units.
- **Simple-Calculator**: A basic calculator implementation demonstrating Rust's input handling and arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

Each project is a standalone Rust application. To run any project:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Use `cargo run` to build and execute the project

```bash
cd Hello-Rust/hello_rust
cargo run
```

## Learning Goals

This repository documents my journey learning Rust, focusing on:

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrency without data races
- Abstraction without overhead
- Practical application development
